If rightMatch exists, this line constructs a mailto: URL. 
The mailto: URL scheme is used to open the default email client of the user. 
When a user clicks on a mailto: link, it will open their default email 
client with the specified email address pre-filled in the "To" field.
 In this case, the email address is taken from the Email property of the rightMatch object.
